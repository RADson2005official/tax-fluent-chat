Project: tax-fluent-chat
Repo purpose: React + Vite front-end for an LLM-powered tax assistant UI.

Key files and folders:
- package.json            (install/dev scripts, dependencies)
- vite.config.ts         (build/dev config)
- public/                (static assets served to the app)
- src/                   (application source code)
  - main.tsx
  - App.tsx
  - components/          (UI components and chat features)
  - pages/               (routes)

How LLMs should access this repository (recommended):
- Include text from these files when building context or vector embeddings:
  - `README.md`, `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`
  - All files under `src/` (especially `components/` and `pages/`)
  - `public/` static files (e.g., `robots.txt`, `placeholder.svg`) as needed
- Exclude: `node_modules/`, build output directories, and any large binary files.

Dev commands (run in repo root):
- Install (npm):    npm install
- Install (bun):    bun install
- Start dev server: npm run dev
- Build production: npm run build
- Preview build:    npm run preview

Notes for LLM ingestion:
- Prefer parsing TypeScript/JSX text as plain text; preserve file paths and small code snippets.
- If building embeddings, chunk files by function/component and keep metadata: `path`, `lang`, `lines`.
- Prioritize `src/components/chat` and `src/components/inputs` for the assistant's behavior.

Contact: repository owner (see git history) for additional private data access.
